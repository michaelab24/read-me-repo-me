# Read Me Generator Lite

## Description 

This application is built to create a professional read me using node and the command line. Upon opening the application you will be presented with a series of prompts that follow the layout of a read me. When prompted with certain questions, if the answer is no, them the question is passed over with either placeholder text or is left blank. When the prompt for a license is presented, if the user is using one, they are presented with 3 options and when one is selected a license is rendered along with an accompanying badge. Once the prompts are completed, a read me is created along with a table of contents that will direct you to their respective sections upon clicking.
